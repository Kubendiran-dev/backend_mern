1. What is Node.js and why is it used in backend development?

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that runs on the server. It is used to build fast, scalable backend applications using event-driven, non-blocking architecture.

2.Difference between synchronous and asynchronous functions in Node.js

Synchronous: Executes line by line, blocks next task.

Asynchronous: Non-blocking, runs tasks in background using callbacks/promises/async-await.

3.Purpose of fs module? Two methods?

fs (File System) module is used to read/write files in Node.js.
Methods:

fs.readFile()

fs.writeFile()

4.Difference between relative and absolute path

Relative: Based on current file location (./routes/user.js)

Absolute: Full system path (D:/project/routes/user.js)

5.What is Express and how different from Node HTTP module?

Express is a framework built on Node.js to simplify server and API creation.
HTTP module is low-level; Express provides routing, middleware, and easier syntax.

6.What is routing in Express? How to create?

Routing means handling different URLs/endpoints.

app.get("/users", (req,res)=>{ res.send("Users"); });
7.Difference between req.params, req.query, req.body

req.params → URL parameters (/user/:id)

req.query → query string (?name=kuben)

req.body → POST request data

8.What is res object? Why important?

res (response object) is used to send data from server to client.
Example: res.send(), res.json(), res.status().

9.Use of HTTP status codes? Name three

Status codes indicate request result.
Examples:

200 → Success

404 → Not found

500 → Server error

10.What is MVC architecture? Why use?

MVC = Model, View, Controller.
It separates logic, UI, and data handling → improves maintainability and scalability.

11.What is MongoDB? Difference from SQL?

MongoDB is a NoSQL database storing data in JSON-like documents.
SQL uses tables/rows; MongoDB uses collections/documents.

12.What is Mongoose and why use?

Mongoose is an ODM library for MongoDB in Node.js.
It helps define schemas, models, and handle database operations easily.

13.What is a schema in Mongoose?

Schema defines the structure of documents in MongoDB.
Example fields, types, validations.

14.What is a model in Mongoose?

Model is a wrapper created from schema to interact with MongoDB collection.
Used for CRUD operations.

15.Mongoose CRUD methods

Create: Model.create()

Read: Model.find() / findById()

Update: Model.updateOne() / findByIdAndUpdate()

Delete: Model.deleteOne() / findByIdAndDelete()
