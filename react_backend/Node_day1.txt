1.what is HTTP modules why we use?

The HTTP module is a built-in Node.js module used to create web servers and handle browser requests/responses.

It allows Node to communicate over the web using the HTTP protocol (same protocol websites use).

We use it to:

1.Create a server  http.createServer()

2.Handle requests from browser  http://localhost:5000

3.Send response back  res.write("Hello"); res.end();

4.Build APIs res.end(JSON.stringify({name:"John"}));


2.what is import export methods.

Import / Export methods are used to share code between files in JavaScript.

Instead of writing everything in one file, we split code into multiple files and connect them using:

export → send code out

import / require → bring code in

5.what is the machine and run time environment it is? in Node

Node.js is a JavaScript runtime environment built on Chrome V8 engine that allows JavaScript to run on a machine (server/computer) outside the browser.
